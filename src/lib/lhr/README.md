## Lighthouse metrics
Main metrics:

- Largest Contentful Paint - LCP - <=2.5s | <=4s | >4s
- Cumulative Layout Shift - CLS - <=100ms | <=300ms | >300ms
- First Input Delay - FID - <=0.1 | <=0.25 | >0.25

Secondary ones:

 - First Contentful Paint - FCP (useful in diagnosing issues with LCP)
 - Speed Index - SI
 - Time to First Byte - TTFB (useful in diagnosing issues with LCP)
 - Time to Interactive - TTI (lab metric)
